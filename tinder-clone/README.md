# React Working
In react every tag which carries any information should be enclosed within a parent tag
thus in react different componenets are created individually and then exported as tags it works in a template sort of manner and improves organisation and readability
Most of icons and ui elements in react also work in the same manner by default. 

# UI elements

Run

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material

in the root directory of the app, i.e tinder-clone directory to use material-ui icons
