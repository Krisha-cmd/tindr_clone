# Learning Mern Stack
Hey! This project is my attempt at the Mern stack, while making this project i had only basic knowledge of React js and i have no prior experience of Node.js MongoDB or Express and even APIs.

# Backend
 The backend will consist of MongoDB for databse and Node.js for backend and Express for serverside javascript. Mongoose will be used to connect to MongoDB
