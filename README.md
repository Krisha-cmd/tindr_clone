# Learning Mern Stack
Hey! This project is my attempt at the Mern stack, while making this project i had only basic knowledge of React js and i have no prior experience of Node.js MongoDB or Express and even APIs.

# Backend
 The backend will consist of MongoDB for databse and Node.js for backend and Express for serverside javascript. Mongoose will be used to connect to MongoDB 
 
 # Frontend
 Frontend will be deployed to firebase
 To host the frontend
 Material-UI will be used for icons and fonts and other UI features.

In the src folder after creating a react app delete app.test.js logo.svg and setupTests.js since they are not required for development.

After that the three basic components for the main page are created in App.js:
1. Header: which contains user, logo and the chat icon
2. Tinder card
3. Functional buttons: delete like and other features
